React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization
Created a dashboard using React, D3, and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize individual playerâ€™s
shot data, including a shot chart and user profile view.
Created four extra filters and two shot themes (hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization on the shot
chart.
Developed an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players (image and name) in the suggestion list.
